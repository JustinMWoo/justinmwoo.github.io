                                                    <p>Minimally Invasive is a VR experience where the player is thrust into the role of a surgeon in a futuristic dystopian universe where they must perform surgery on aliens and cyborgs. The player pilots a bus fitted with technology to shrink down and enter the patient and perform the necessary surgeries. After flying to the destination within the bus, the player can exit and use tentacle like mechanical arms to interact with environmental puzzles to treat the patient.</p>

                                                    <p>
                                                        I designed the mechanical tool arms to mimic the controls of real world surgical tools if they were controlled from a first-person perspective while also keeping them fun to use. The arms can be deployed whenever the player is grounded. They are controlled by holding down the clutch button and moving and orienting the controller. The tool arms are physics based, allowing them to knock around objects in the environment and react to other forces. <br><br> This page will go through a quick demonstration of how each tool functions in game, followed by a more in-depth look on into the blueprints.

                                                    <p>
                                                        The transform of the head of the tool is set through the animation blueprint using inverse kinematics to orient the bones in the arm. Each arm has a target location that is moved directly as the player controls the tool. The target location is attached through a physics constraint to the collision parent (a set of collision objects that represent the collision of the tool head) in order to give the tool its physics-based movement. The control of the arm functions by taking a snapshot of the location and rotation of the player's hands relative to their character when the clutch button is pressed. Then the offset is calculated between the new transform of their hands and the snapshot. The location offset is applied to the target location to adjust its position. The rotation of the hand is adjusted to the orientation of the player and then transformed to the direction of the target location to rotate the tool in a way that feels natural to the player.
                                                        Lastly, if the movement of the player's hand was great enough to cause the arm to move out of its maximum range, an adjusted offset vector is calculated by determining the length of a vector in the direction of the offset vector that intersects with the maximum radius of the arm.

When deployed, the tool shows which parts of the environment can be cut and which angle and location they must be cut at. The scalpel is used in conjunction with other tools in order to perform tasks including severing veins and redirecting blood flow. Physics constraints are leveraged to lock the scalpel into a plane of movement that lines up with the blade as it makes contact. These constraints also provide resistance to simulate more realistic cutting through tissue. Additionally, the scalpel can be used to fend off enemies.</p>

                                                    <p>This tool is used to siphon liquids from the environment to use throughout the body to perform different tasks. Liquids including acids and naturally occurring antibiotics and anti-inflammatories can be found throughout the body and, when siphoned into the syringe, will be stored in canisters located on the arms. These canisters can be removed and stored in the player's inventory. The tool can then be used to inject these fluids into tissues that require them. Through a clever use of physics constraints and collision manipulation, the needle of the syringe can only be inserted into tissues using the tip and will lock itself into movement in the direction of the needle when inserted while providing resistance to simulate insertion into tissue.</p>

                                                        The scanner is a diagnostic tool used to probe the environment and gather information about the player's surroundings. By default, it reveals a circular area at the location it is pointed at and reveals hidden patterns underneath the surface of the tissue. This can be used to solve puzzles and find connected elements throughout the patient's body. The tool utilizes sphere traces, overlay materials and material parameters to dynamically set the location in the world that should have overlay materials shown by the scanner.
                                                        <br />
                                                        The scanner also has a second function. By holding the trigger, the player is able to display a card describing the properties of the scanned object and how to interact with it.

                                                    <p>If you made it through the demonstrations and would like a more in-depth look into how it works, you've come to the right section! The image above shows the main parts of the blueprint that control the movement of the mechanical tool arms. The mechanical arm hierarchy has the primarily visual skeletal mesh "ArmMesh" along with the "MovementCollisionParent", "TargetAnchor" and "TargetLocation". The movement collision parent allows for each of the mechanical arm tool heads to have a separate collision shape that can be changed during the game (a more detailed description of the tool structure is in the following section). The movement collision parent has physics simulated for it and is attached to the "TargetLocation" using physics constraints. The movement of the arm is then calculated using the "TargetAnchor" which is updated when the arm's clutch is released and the direction of the player's hand movement in relation to its snapshot location. Then a calculation determines if the target location is within the max range of the arm and sets the "TargetLocation" if it is.
													If it is not in range, there is a following calculation using the location out of range, the base of the arm and the "TargetAnchor" to determine a new location in the same direction as the intended movement that is within the maximum range.</p>

                                                    <h4><em>The Details: Tool Heads</em></h4>
                                                    <p>When the blueprint structure for the tool heads were designed, I wanted to make sure that we could easily swap the player's tools depending on the scenario and potentially add more tools to their arsenal as we came across more ideas. Thus, I created a system with a base Actor Component with basic functionality such as activating, deactivating and constructing the tools which could then also be overwritten in the child classes for each individual tool type. This allowed for the use of an array of each of the tool classes that were wanted on the player that would be initialized with a simple loop and could be changed at any time. It also meant that creating new tool arms was a simple process of creating a new child class, assigning some variables and adding the arm's functionality to the component.</p>

The "WBP_MechArmsInventory" consists of several "WBP_MechArmButtons". These buttons contain a background image, thumbnail for the tool, the tool's name and a button with 3 blank images to accommodate the hexagonal shape of the buttons. When the buttons are clicked the index of the specific tool on the mech arm is determined and the tool on the arm is set. The buttons are initialized from the inventory by assigning each tool head to a button using a map to find the corresponding information for the tool.</p>

                                                    <p>For setting up audio I worked directly with our audio designer in order to create a system that would function how he envisioned it and would be easy for him to interact and test sounds in with minimal Unreal experience. There were many sounds systems that we worked on and created together, with one of the main ones being a switch for the sound based on the material that was collided with or cut. Using the system he designed within WWise for the audio mixing, I created several functions that changed the switches and variables on WWise's end to adjust the sounds accordingly and could be easily modified as new sounds were added. This was one of many examples where we collaborated together throughout the development of Minimally Invasive to design the sound system.</p>
